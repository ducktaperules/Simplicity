## Step 1 - print and prep your parts

Print all nessacary parts from the part list found in the [parts list here](/CAD/)
<p><img src="Photos\InstructionsPrintParts.jpg" width="400" height="300"></a></p>

Remove any brims and support. deburr any sharp edegs and remove any bumps on surfaces.
<p><img src="Photos\InstructionsDeburrParts.jpg" width="400" height="300"></a></p>

I recommend to clearance drill most holes to the correct size to ensure easy assembly.

drill 3mm for the 8 holes in the X stage, the 12 stepper motor screws in the base part, the 4 in the Print Head, and the 5 in the bed mount.
<p><img src="Photos\InstructionsDrill3mm.jpg" width="400" height="300"></a></p>

drill 5mm for the 7 holes in both the mid and top parts (dont forget the sideways one for the tensioner), as well as the holes through the tensioners and the 2 in the extruder mount if your using it.
<p><img src="Photos\InstructionsDrill5mm.jpg" width="400" height="300"></a></p>

drill 8mm for the 2 holes in both the base and mid parts.

IMPORTANT NOTE: These 8mm holes do not go all the way through so drill carefully till you touch the step. On the base this is most the way through, on the mid part its about 15mm in.
<p><img src="Photos\InstructionsDrill8mm.jpg" width="400" height="300"></a>
<img src="Photos\InstructionsDrill8mm2.jpg" width="400" height="300"></a></p>

Finally put the M5 heat set inserts in. There are 7 in the mid part, 1 in the top and 1 in each tensioner.
<p><img src="Photos\InstructionsHeatSet1.jpg" width="400" height="300"></a>
<img src="Photos\InstructionsHeatSet.jpg" width="400" height="300"></a></p>

## Step 2 - Build The Base

The 8mm Steel rods can be inserted into the 4 holes in the base. they must be pushed down until they bottom out on the lip at the bottom of the print
<p><img src="Photos\InstructionsRodClose.jpg" width="400" height="300"></a></p>

Next the 3 drive steppers can be mounted at the back with 12x M3x8 CSK screws. their cables or plugs should face inwards towards the electronics.
<p><img src="Photos\InstructionsSteppers.jpg" width="400" height="300"></a></p>

## Step 3 - Build The Bed

i forgot to take many pics of this but basically . . .

The bearings can be inserted into the bed.
The lead screw nut gets screwed in with 2x M3x8 screws. 
The lead screw can be inserted. 
The bed can be fitted.

<p><img src="Photos\InstructionsBed.jpg" width="400" height="300"></a></p>

Once you lubricate the bearings, the bed can slide onto the rear linear rods.

The couplers can also be put in place but don't tighten them fully just yet.

<p><img src="Photos\InstructionsBedInstalled.jpg" width="400" height="300"></a></p>

## Step 4 - Build The XY stage

This step is the most complex bit. mak sure to pay attention to how many washers are needed and where they go.

Firstly assemble the Tensionsers. These have M5x25 CSK screw inserted from one side then a stack of washer-bearing-bearing-washer before screwing into the heat set insert.

PROTIP: if theres extra plastic in the hole from putting in the heat set then it can be useful to first put the screw through from the heat set side to clear the hole, then remove it and reinstall the correct way.

<p><img src="Photos\InstructionsTensioners.jpg" width="400" height="300"></a></p>

Next prepare the Drive Pulleys bars. On one end of the 5mm Rods you need to put a bearing,some washers and the pulley. The left and right assembly's are a little different so pay attention to the washer positions and pulley orientations shown below. There should be a single washer on the tooth side of the pulley and 2 washers on the grub side. The pulleys can be secured wit the grub screws and should have about 4mm of rod left sticking.

PROTIP: If the bearing is stiff to go on it can sometimes help to sand the rod a little by putting it in a drill and holding some mid grit sandpaper on the end.

<p><img src="Photos\InstructionsDrivePulleys.jpg" width="400" height="300"></a></p>

Now is a good time to grease your rails.

Then the X rail can be secured to the Gantry with 8 screws, I recommend tightening screws from the middle outwards.

<p><img src="Photos\InstructionsXrail.jpg" width="400" height="300"></a></p>

The small bearings can then be put into the Gantry and the M3x25 screws inserted to hold them in place. Like with the tensioners these stacks should have washer-bearing-bearing-washer however this time using M3 washers and bearings.

<p><img src="Photos\InstructionsXpulleys.jpg" width="400" height="300"></a></p>

The other 2 rails can then be placed on the Mid Section. at this pint you  want to just put the end 2 screws in loosely so that the rails can move around a little.

<p><img src="Photos\InstructionsYrailsLoose.jpg" width="400" height="300"></a></p>

The X gantry can now be placed on the Y bearing blocks and the screws inserted loosley. Both Y blocks should be pushed all the way to the back an then the gantry pulley screws can be tightened. This ensures that the gantry is mounted square.

<p><img src="Photos\InstructionsXinstall.jpg" width="400" height="300"></a></p>

The Y rail screws can then be inserted and tightened one at a time working from the back forwards, each time you move forwards move the gantry as close to the screw as possible as this will ensure the rails get set parallel.

<p><img src="Photos\InstructionsYrailsTight.jpg" width="400" height="300"></a></p>

Once the Y rails are secured and parallel you can push the gantry all the way back, loosten the pulley screws again, insert the other ones in the gantry and re-tighten, this is just to ensure that the Y blocks are parallel to the rails.

At this point your gantry should smoothly move along the rails, if theres any points of binding then you might need to loosen the Y rails and try again.

<p><img src="Photos\InstructionsXYcomplete.jpg" width="400" height="300"></a></p>

## Step 5 - Assemble The Belt Paths

The top part can be placed top side down with 6x M5x35 CSK screws in the 5mm holes.

2 of the 5mm ID bearings can be pushed into the bearing seats near the tensionsers

<p><img src="Photos\InstructionsBeltBearings.jpg" width="400" height="300"></a></p>

The bearing stacks can then be placed on top of these screws, the stacks on the arms go washer-bearing-bearing-washer. The stacks at the back are washer-bearing-bearing-washer-bearing-bearing-washer as shown above.

Once the stacks are complete they should look as shown below. The tensionsers can be placed in their slots with the sloped edges facing towards the center.

<p><img src="Photos\InstructionsBeltBearingsFitted.jpg" width="400" height="300"></a></p>

The XY stage mid section from earlier can then have the Drive Pulleys inserted into it, making sure the bearings seat firmly. I recommend to place them as shown below.

Note that i have also installed the M5x25 tensioning screws, it can be done later but its easier now.

<p><img src="Photos\InstructionsInsertDrivePulleys.jpg" width="400" height="300"></a></p>

Now the Fiddly bit.

Both parts need to marry together, the best way i have found to do this is to carefully stand both parts together, making sure the screws don't fall out as you do it. 

<p><img src="Photos\InstructionsTopAlmostTogether.jpg" width="400" height="300"></a></p>

Get them close enough that you can start the threads on the 4 bolts. Once all 4 are started you can push the 2 parts together ensuring that the tensioner blocks are correctly in their channels. then you can tighten down all 6 of the M5 CSK bolts.

<p><img src="Photos\InstructionsTopTogether.jpg" width="400" height="300"></a></p>

## Step 6 - Put the top on the bottom

As the title says, put the top on the bottom. 

Be careful to ensure that all 4 8mm rods go into their holes correctly. Also make sure that the 5mm rods go into the couplers. if your print has any warp the rods might not line up up fully but just get them in there and the couplers and bearing stacks will ensure that everything aligns properly.

Make sure that the top is fully seated. Check this by measuring the distance from the base to the top, it should be the same at all 4 rods. 

<p><img src="Photos\InstructionsTopOn.jpg" width="400" height="300"></a></p>

The couplers can now be tightened. there should be a gap between the stepper and the rod for the A/B motors which the coupler will cover.

For the Z the rod should rest directly on the stepper shaft to ensure reliable sensor-less homing. the coupler should be positioned so that the brass nut bottoms out on the coupler and leaves 1-2mm clearance between the bottom of the bed and the base as shown below.

<p><img src="Photos\InstructionsCouplers.jpg" width="400" height="300"></a></p>

## Step 7 - Run the Belts

The belts get attached to the print head by inserting through the inner most hole from the back, then back through the outer hole, then cable tied so that some of the teeth lock together.

<p><img src="Photos\InstructionsAttachBelts.jpg" width="400" height="300"></a></p>

The print head can be held in place on the gantry by a single screw.

The lower belt passes all the way through the lower hole. the upper belt goes round the pulley in the gantry and then round the bearing at the front of the frame.

<p><img src="Photos\InstructionsBelts1.jpg" width="400" height="300"></a></p>

The lower belt passes all the way through the lower hole. the upper belt goes round the pulley in the gantry and then round the bearing at the front of the frame.

<p><img src="Photos\InstructionsBelts1.jpg" width="400" height="300"></a></p>

Belts are brought to the back corner. The upper belt goes all the way round the upper bearing, in round the pulley, then back out round the tensioner block. The lower belt just goes round the corner bearing.

<p><img src="Photos\InstructionsBelts2.jpg" width="400" height="300"></a></p>

Now the other back corner, this time the lower belt goes round the tensioner, in round the pulley, out round the lower corner bearing. the upper belt just goes straight round the upper corner bearing.

<p><img src="Photos\InstructionsBelts3.jpg" width="400" height="300"></a></p>

The upper belt now goes in to the gantry. The lower comes round the front corner bearing and back to the X gantry and round the lower gantry bearing.

<p><img src="Photos\InstructionsBelts4.jpg" width="400" height="300"></a></p>

Take the screw holding the tool head out and then both belts then get inserted into the inner holes of the print head

<p><img src="Photos\InstructionsBelts5.jpg" width="400" height="300"></a></p>

Then back through the outer hole. 

At this pint pulling the ends will cause the belts to tighten. Pull them to a good level of tight by hand. Work your way round ensuring that the belts are sat correctly in the pulleys all the way round. belts should be reasonably tight.

<p><img src="Photos\InstructionsBelts6.jpg" width="400" height="300"></a></p>

You can now secure the print head to the X bearing block and cable tie the other end of the belts to finaly secure them. 

Now is your chance to do a better job of cutting the belts to length that i did.

<p><img src="Photos\InstructionsBeltsDone.jpg" width="400" height="300"></a></p>

If you want to test things rotating the couplers by hand should move to print head smoothly.

## Step 8 - Assemble Hot End

Home stretch now, my instruction from here doesn't really cover to much detail over wiring and cable routing as i feel like plenty of other guides cover this.

Hot end heatsink block screws in with 2x M2.5x16 self tapping screws

<p><img src="Photos\InstructionsAttachHotEnd.jpg" width="400" height="300"></a></p>

3010 fan then screws on the front with another 4 self tapping screws.

I found it useful to secure the wires with a cable tie that can be placed around the top fan support.

<p><img src="Photos\InstructionsAttachFan.jpg" width="400" height="300"></a></p>

Extruder mount plate (if your using mine) is screwed in between the extruder and its stepper motor.

This can the be mounted to the printer by removing the 2 middle rear M5x35 screws, placing the mount on top and replacing the screws 

<p><img src="Photos\InstructionsAttachExtruder.jpg" width="400" height="300"></a></p>

---

## Step 9 - Install Electronics

Raspberry pi and SKR Pico can be mounted to the electronics tray with some of the small self tapping screws.

Power can be wired in from external PSU and cable tied for strain relief.

<p><img src="Photos\InstructionsElectronicsTray.jpg" width="400" height="300"></a></p>

If your using an electronics tray, There are additional places in the base where Heat Set Inserts can be added for securing accessories. My tray just uses the other most holes on the sides. But these can be fitted as and when they are needed.

<p><img src="Photos\InstructionsElectronicsHeatSet.jpg" width="400" height="300"></a></p>

Electronics tray can then be installed.

Steppers plug in, Hot End gets wired in, thermistor plugs in, hot end fan plugs in.

Jumpers for A, B and Z added to pico for sensor-less homing.

<p><img src="Photos\InstructionsElectronicsInstalled.jpg" width="400" height="300"></a></p>

All cables that come out he the electronics area can pass through this small cut out.

Theres a small hole below it allowing the cables to be secured into the gap with a cable tie.
<p><img src="Photos\InstructionsElectronicsInstalled.jpg" width="400" height="300"></a></p>

## Step 10 - Done

Flip it back over and marvel at what you have built.

<p><img src="..\Photos\Simplicity_1.0_Front_Low.png"></a></p>

Well done. 

Now you just need to follow a tutorial to install and set up klipper and your ready to print.

TODO (for me):
Add a link to my example klipper config files and homing scripts.
