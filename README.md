## 🧐 Info about Simplicity <a name = "info"></a>
Simplicity was designed as a compact desktop printer for the everyman. Its well suited to printing small parts quickly and accurately. Its easy to source, build and maintain, whilst looking good enough that you can keep it on show and accessible at all times.

## 📱 Features <a name = "features"></a>
 - CoreXY Design
 - 3D Printed Frame (prints on 220x220mm bed)
 - Looks Good
 - Few separate parts to print.
 - Less than 500g of filament to print all parts.
 - Integrated belt tension adjustment.
 - Bottom mounted motors for improved stability
 - Voron V0 Bed Support

## 💡 Inspiration <a name = "inspiration"></a>
### Voron V0 (https://github.com/VoronDesign/Voron-0)
The V0 is one of the most popular desktop printers that has shown what small format FDM printers are capable of. I wanted one for a long time however theres 3 main things that have put me off:
 -  Sourcing - There are so many the different parts to source. Aluminum extrusions, Odd size motors, Custom Beds, Specific extruders, acrylic panels, 
 - Printing - As of today the V0.2 print list currently has 143 parts to print. The thought of having to download, organize, slice, print and clean this many parts is a daunting task in its self. Especially if you don't already own a printer that tuned to perfection.
- Building - For some this is the fun bit, but for many this can be a tedious and frustrating endeavour. 

### Rolohaun Rook (https://github.com/rolohaun/Rook)
The Rook is a relatively new printer focused around making small format printers more accessible. I think the idea of using a printed frame is great and theres now enough of them out in the wild to prove that this can be a reliable option if designed well. I also love the use of vertical linear rods for both the bed and as structural frame component. 

That said, the Rook design optimized for function over aesthetics. IMO it also has an unnecessary number of individual parts to print that require a decent tolerance to work correctly.

## 🤘 Ethos <a name = "ethos"></a>

### Simple to Print
Simplicity is designed to have as few separate parts as possible, all of which should be printable without supports. Its also designed so that tolerances in most places are not critical and everything should fit together first try.

### Built from common parts
Due to the small lightweight design, good results can easily be achieved with cheep components or old spare parts. Any Junker 42mm stepper motors will give speeds and accelerations. Im also using the Creality hot end as they are available everywhere and many even have them spare from previous printers.

### Easy to mod
The stock configuration i have provided is the minimum needed to get up and running however i expect there will be many mods allowing better cooling, different print heads, enclosures, and electronics mounting for many different control boards.

<br>

## 📋 To Do List <a name = "to_do_list"></a>
There are a few things i need to do in the short term.
 - Upload STL files ✅
 - Upload STEP files
 - Add pictures ✅
 - Add instruction manual ✅
 - Write BOM ✅(kinda)
 - Design parts variant that use M3 heat set inserts rather than self tapping screws.
 - Maybe Belted Z Mod

<br>

## 🚀 Future Scope <a name = "future_scope"></a>
There are a lot of things i would like to improve in the future.
 - Printhead with built in part cooling fans 
 - Electronics Cover for those who want to  hide their shame
 - Full enclosure with door and lid for better printing of ABS
